  <h1>Exness Leverage & Margin Explained: How It Works</h1>
    <p>Leverage and margin are two of the most critical concepts in Forex trading, especially for traders using Exness. Understanding these elements can help maximize potential gains while effectively managing risks. In this guide, we will break down how leverage and margin work on Exness and how you can use them strategically to enhance your trading experience.</p>
    <h2>What is Leverage in Forex Trading?</h2>
    <p>Leverage is essentially borrowed capital that allows traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of actual funds. Exness offers one of the most competitive leverage options in the industry, providing traders with flexibility to amplify their trading potential.</p>
    <p>For example, if you use a leverage of 1:1000, this means you can control a position size 1000 times larger than your actual investment. If you have $100 in your account, you could open trades worth up to $100,000.</p>
    <h3>Advantages of Using Leverage on Exness</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Increased Market Exposure</strong>: Allows traders to access larger positions with minimal capital.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher Profit Potential</strong>: Small price movements can result in significant gains.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Trading</strong>: Exness offers variable leverage options based on account type and market conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Risks of Leverage</h3>
    <p>While leverage magnifies profits, it also increases the risk of losses. A highly leveraged position can lead to rapid account depletion if the market moves against your trade. Proper risk management, such as setting stop-loss orders and using appropriate position sizes, is crucial when trading with high leverage.</p>
     <h2>Understanding Margin in Exness</h2>
    <p>Margin is the amount of capital required to open and maintain a leveraged position. It acts as collateral for the borrowed funds used in trading. Exness calculates margin requirements based on your chosen leverage and trade size.</p>
    <p>For instance, if you open a trade worth $10,000 with a leverage of 1:100, your margin requirement will be $100 (1% of the trade size).</p>
    <h3>Key Margin Terms on Exness:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Margin Level (%)</strong>: (Equity / Used Margin) Ã— 100. If your margin level drops below a certain threshold, Exness may initiate a margin call or automatically close positions to prevent further losses.</li>
        <li><strong>Margin Call</strong>: A warning when your margin level falls to a critical level, prompting you to deposit more funds or close positions.</li>
        <li><strong>Stop Out Level</strong>: The point where Exness automatically closes positions to protect the trader from incurring excessive losses.</li>
    </ul>
